We added new features which included blog posts with customized features, a newsletter and sharing capabilities (pretty much inspired by the Medium website). We also added pages for Jobs, Podcast and Videos.</p><p> Today, the website looks very different from what we had when I was working on it. However, it is possible to look into the previous iterations of the website using the Way Back Machine.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This project was developed in 2017 during my internship at the <b>Midi-Pyrenées Observatory</b>.</p> <p>It required me to work on a new Wordpress theme using PHP, HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript to handle a few extra functionalities. It also required the use of custom fields and scripting special queries to get specific logs. One of the most difficult features (at the time) was the making of a simplified form to submit logs quickly without the need to access the Wordpress panel.</p> <p>The observatory workers were continuously asking about their desired features and bringing up their issues with the tool they had, then it was my job to proppose and develop the solutions. </p>",

We were told to be creative and <i>“make the new website give the same feeling as the first one while having a more modern look”</i>.</p> <p>For this project I was allowed to make proposals to the client while the designers guided me to make my ideas more user friendly.</p> <p>I used a lot of CSS for the effects and colors, while HTML, PHP and Javascript were reserved only for additional effects. Most of the elements on each page were created used the WPBakery plugin for Wordpress.<p> </p>This was more of a design revamp than a functional one and I was happy to work with that much creative freedom and know that the client was very happy with what we had accomplished.</p>",
