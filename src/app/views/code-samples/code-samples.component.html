<h2>Dynamic numbers</h2>
<div class="counters">
	<h3>Simple</h3>
	<p><b>There are <dynumber
		[value]="x"
		type="simple"
		></dynumber>
	visitors right now.</b></p>
    <p>The simple animation will show the new number going up or down, depending on its relation against the previous value.</p>

	<h3>Linear</h3>
	<p><b>$<dynumber
		[value]="e"
		type="linear"
		[optimize]="true"
		></dynumber>
	earned today overall. <i>(Optimized)</i></b></p>
	<p><b>$<dynumber
		[value]="e"
		type="linear"
		[optimize]="false"
		></dynumber>
	earned today overall. <i>(Non optimized)</i></b></p>
    <p>The linear animation will make the numbers transition towards the final value. <br>
    The difference between Optimized and Non-optimized is that the Optimized one only animates through a few numbers between the previous and the new value, while the Non-optimized one goes through all the numbers. If the difference between both of them is large you'll get a lag spike in the client's browser because of it. It is recommended to always go for the Optimized one. I bet you didn't notice the difference (visually) anyway.<br>
    It is also recommended to use monospace typographies for this one or you'll numbers will make your text shake.</p>

	<!-- <h3>Individual</h3>
	<p>$<dynumber
		[value]="i"
		type="individual"
        [duration]="100"
		></dynumber>
	earned in the last hour.</p> -->
</div>
